\chapter{Software Ecosystems}\label{ch:softwareEcosystems}
To this class belong software systems that are built on top of a technical software platform by composing components developed by actors both internal and external.
                                               	
\begin{itemize}
\item IDEs: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Eclipse Ecosystem: The Eclipse ecosystem is the universe of Eclipse plugins together with the developers of these plugins. All different Eclipse plugins rely on a common underlying architecture, platform and set of libraries without which they are unable to function correctly. The community of plugin developers therefore shares the common goal of improving a complete integrated software development environment.        	 
\end{itemize}
                
\item Programming Language Community: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The CRAN Ecosystem (cran.r-project.org): The GNU R community shares the
  goal of creating a statistical computing environment. It achieves this through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), a developer-centric ecosystem in which each community member can contribute packages implementing specific statistical analysis functions and visualization tools. A particularity of this ecosystem is that the community is mainly composed of end-users, that do not necessarily have a lot of development experience. CRAN has been experiencing maintainability problems due to the superlinearly growing number of packages and the limitations of Râ€™s dependency versioning system.
