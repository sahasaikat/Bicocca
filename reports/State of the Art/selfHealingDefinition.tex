\chapter{Self-Healing Definition} \label{ch:selfHelingDefinition}

A self-healing software system is a software architecture that empowers the continuous and programmed observing, analysis, and remediation of software faults. Self-healing software architecture consists of two parts: The software service whose accessibility we are keen on enhancing and The components of the framework that perform the monitoring, diagnosis and healing \cite{Keromytis:SelfHealingSurvey:2011}.\\

Self-healing can be defined as the property that enables a system to perceive that it is not
operating correctly and, without (or with) human intervention, make the necessary adjustments to restore itself to normalcy. Healing systems that require human intervention can be categorized as assisted-healing systems\cite{Ghosh:SelfHealingSurvey:2007}.\\

Self-healing system should recover from the abnormal (or “unhealthy”) state and return to the normative (“healthy”) state, and function as it was prior to disruption \cite{Harald:SelfHealingSurvey:2011}.\\
